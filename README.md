## Team Name: 

Already Cooked


## Member Names: 

Sankalp Amaravadi, Aahil Hasnain, Joshua Oh


## Program Purpose: 

We designed this software to assist people to keep up with language trends in the digital age in a 'fun' and inventive way.  


## Problems: 

One problem we faced was getting the AI to work with our program and the JS file to wk at all.  Another problem we found we had was we could not work on the application at the same time.


## How we dealt with the problems:

We found the documentation for our systems that allowed us to work through said concerns.  We decided to fix on our issue by only having one person work on the application at a given moment with the other team members assisting by finding the proper documentation.

## Tools used:

- VSCode
- Copilot
- ChatGPT
- Google Gemini
- Youtube
